				It's a classic story, really:
				<br><br>
				Boy meets girl over the internet, girl is just focusing on herself and her career but has never had Ethiopian, so decides- “what the hell?” Boy is funnier than she thought, girl learns to program, boy helps. Girl changes careers and DEFINITELY DOES NOT HAVE A CRISIS ABOUT IT, boy cooks really nice salmon. They go to Philly and it's unbearably humid. Boy meets her boys. Girl likes his clean apartment. They say screw it, the rent is too damn high. They get an owl.
				<br><br>
				Like I said, classic.
