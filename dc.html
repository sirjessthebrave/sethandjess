            <h2>The Ceremony</h2>
            <p>
                Well... there isn't one! We're more interested in drinking and dancing with our friends than walking down the aisle. So head straight to the reception when you're ready to join us!

            <h2>The Reception</h2>
            <p><strong>Where:</strong> <a href="http://ivycitysmokehouse.com/tavern/">Ivy City Smokehouse</a> | 1356 Okie St NE, Washington, DC</p>
            <p><strong>When:</strong> Saturday, May 26th, 2018 6:30 PM - 11:30 PM</p>
            <p><strong>What:</strong> Drinks, Hors d'oeuvres, and Dancing</p>
            <p>Join us for a night of drinking, dancing, and smoked fish! (There will be other food as well, if smoked fish is not your scene). We're becoming life partners and we want you there to be a part of the celebration. Rumor has it that there will be an after party at <a href="http://www.bigchiefdc.com/">Big Chief</a> right next door when we're done at the Smokehouse.</p>
            <p>The reception venue is a couple miles from the hotels and there's no metro station, so we recommend using a taxi or Lyft to get there. There are several distilleries, breweries, and restaurants in the area if you're looking for something to do before the reception.</p>
            <p><strong>Dress Code:</strong> Whatever makes you feel funky. Be that a 3-piece suit, a sequin gown, or your freshest t-shirt. It's all good.</p>

            <p>We'll be staying at a rental unit in the 1300 block of 9th St NW. If you're travelling and need a hotel we recommend <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/wasco-marriott-marquis-washington-dc/">The Marriot Marquis</a> or <a href="http://www.dcdowntownhotel.com/">The Comfort Inn Downtown</a>. Both are nearby and within walking distance of all the best DC attractions. There are also plenty of AirBNBs in the area if you prefer not to stay in a hotel.</p>
