Hello, friends! Jess and I recently spent a week in Huasteca Potosina, a picturesque region in central Mexico known for its rolling landscapes and brilliant, blue waters. We had been living in Mexico City for a couple months and we wanted to spend a little time outside the city around the holidays. We were really craving some fresh air after our time in the beautiful, but smoggy, city. Our friend Jonathan suggested Huasteca Potosina in central Mexico, which Jess and I were not familiar with. We Googled some pictures and were sold on the idea pretty quickly. The rainforests, the waterfalls, and the thatch-roofed huts on the river were exactly what we were looking for in our trip.

Huasteca Potosina is a popular vacation destination among locals, but it hasn't quite caught on internationally. We knew we wanted to go, but it was tricky to find information in English. We also weren't sure how we were going to get around since the region is a 7 hour drive from Mexico City and many of the attractions are in remote areas. We ultimately decided to take a bus from Mexico City and book a 5 day tour package since, other than the pictures we saw, we knew nothing about the area or what to expect. If you're thinking about going to Huasteca Potosina (you should!) read on and you'll be a little more informed than we were when we arrived.

## Geography and History

The Huasteca region extends through several modern Mexican states and stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. The area is named after the indigenous Huastec people that have inhabited the region for centuries. There are still people that speak the native Huastec language and follow Huastec traditions, but their influence has waned since the Spanish colonization.

Huasteca Potosina is specifically the part of the Huasteca region that lies within the state of San Luis Potosí. It's a mountainous, rainforest zone with several winding rivers whose beauty attract tourists from all over Mexico. The limestone of the Sierra Madre Orientals causes the rivers to glow a beautiful and almost luminescent blue in the sunlight. The area is temperate most of the year, but temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius at the height of Summer. Be sure to check the weather forecast before your trip. Agriculture is the most imporant part of the economy here and as you navigate the mountain roads you can see mile after mile of sugar cane fields. The region is also known for its coffee, so be sure to have a cup if you get the chance.

## Transportation and Accomodations

The city of Ciudad Valles lies in the heart of Huasteca Potosina, so this was the first stop on our trip. Mexico City bus stations are hectic places, and schedules are pretty loosely followed, but after some jostling and bit of a wait we were on our way. Several bus companies offer daily trips to the area. Some leave first thing in the morning and others leave late in the evening. This is a good deal if you can manage to sleep on a bus. Jess and I were doubtful, so we opted for a day bus. It was a 9 hour ride, but the Futura bus we took had comfortable seats and a bathroom, so we managed. We arrived in the evening and grabbed a taxi (no Lyft or Uber here) to a little hotel near the tour company office. English speakers are few and far between this far from the big city, so getting around and getting checked in really tested our Spanish abilities. There was some confusion, but we managed. We were feeling pretty gross after sitting on a bus all day, but a hot shower and some dinner at a little restaurant in town fixed us right up.

We booked a 5 day tour package through [Ruta Huasteca](https://www.rutahuasteca.com/), so once we got to town all the details were taken care of for us. I'm really glad we went this route. As I mentioned, there aren't a lot of English speakers in the area and our Spanish isn't great (yet). Also, the attractions in the area are spread out and difficult to find so it's helpful to have guides to show you the way and provide safety equipment. We only spent the first night in the hotel. We spent the remainder of our evenings at Aldea Huasteca, an ecological lodging complex run by Ruta Huasteca. Letting them take care of all the details meant we could focus on enjoying the trip. Lodging, transportation, meals, equipment, and guides were all provided.

We didn't really know what to expect when we started the trip, which made packing difficult. But now that we know we're to help. Hopefully you won't go in as blind as we did. First, a lot of the activities involve swimming. A bathing suit is a must. Water shoes are also essential, but you can buy them at all the destinations if you don't own a pair. You'll need to bring your own towel, as well. Since we were using our towels for showers and swimming they were pretty gross by the end of the week. There's nothing like drying off with a damp, mildewy towel after your morning shower. Consider bringing a micro-fiber sport towel if you've got one, so you're not stuck lugging your shower towel around everywhere. A good pair of hiking shoes will also serve you well. You'll spend a lot of time climing up and down muddy mountainsides. All of your clothes will get wet and muddy, so don't bring your Sunday best. Our eco-lodging didn't sell alcohol, so make sure to bring your own beers or favorite spirit if you like to relax with a drink after a day of adventuring. We always bring a bottle of wine on trips in case of just such contingencies. All of the excursions feature a lunch in town so it's easy enough to swing by an Oxxo for a six-pack if you feel the need.

One thing that really confused me about all of the destinations in Huasteca Potosina was the lack of dedicated changing rooms. Thousands of tourists come through these places and need to change into and out of bathing attire so you would think that somebody would build some rooms dedicated to this purpose, but alas, no. Everybody is stuck trying to change behind opened car doors or in cramped and foul public bathrooms. As is standard in Mexico public bathrooms cost 5 or 6 pesos, so bring some change, and try not to think about why the floor is so wet.

## The Rivers

Many of the area's attractions are in and around the beautiful waterways that twist through the Sierra Madre Orientals. There are calm areas for swimming, rapids for rafting, and beautiful waterfalls for jumping. The three rivers in the area are the Río Tampaón, the Río Valles, and the Río Gallinas. There are many natural formations along these waterways that provide a multitude of beautiful sites and fun activities.

### Rafting

The Tampaón provides excellent opportunities for rafting, and there are several tour companies that plan daily outings. The most turbulent areas are [class III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_scale_of_river_difficulty), but the guides are skilled and there are numerous attendants in kayaks waiting to help if anybody falls out. I had never been rafting before and I felt perfectly safe. The walls of the cavern formed by the river are breathtaking, and are worth the trip even if you are otherwise not interested in rafting.

### The waterfalls

The rivers of Huasteca Potosina are full of waterfalls, big and small. The tour companies in the area offer excursions to appreciate their beauty and to jump down them to the deep water below. I admit that the idea of jumping off an 8 meter waterfall was terrifying to me at first glance, but once I built up my courage by jumping from some smaller ones I was able to relax and enjoy it. It's perfectly safe and I suggest giving it a try, even if you're nervous (I know I was).

### Tamul

Located near the town of Tanchachín is Tamul, the largest waterfall in the area and perhaps the most beautiful in Mexico. It has a 105 meter (344 foot) drop and is formed where Río Gallinas meets Río Tampaón. As with all the rivers in the area the water is a beautiful blue due to the limestone in the mountains and riverbed. If you go with a tour group you can expect to get on the water several kilometers upstream. The river is full of groups in long canoes, struggling to mantain synchronicty in their paddling. Luckily every boat is managed by some experts who handle the steering. Expect your arms to be sore by the end of the day, though.

The canoes converge at a cluster of rocks about half a kilometer from the falls. There's usually a line as groups wait their turn to get photos with the falls in the background. This is a good opportunity to do some swimming and jump from the rock formations (if you are brave). This is as close as you'll get to the falls by boat. The water becomes very turbulent after this, so it's not safe to approach by water.

Along the river is the [cenote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenote) Cueva del Agua. The calm water and the cavernous surroundings make this a wonderful place to swim. When we went the water in the cenote was considerably warmer than the river water, so it was a nice break.

For more information about Tamul check out [the Wikipedia page ](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascada_de_Tamul) (en español) and [this](https://matadornetwork.com/read/visit-tamul-waterfall-mexico/) short guide from the Matador Network.

### Puente de Dios

Outside the town of Tamasopo lies Puente de Dios, or the Bridge of God. Waterfalls cascade into a beautiful natural pool that is surrounded on all sides by vines, ferns, and other jungle vegitation. The water has formed channels in the rocks, and these watery caves glow with a natural luminesence that has to be seen to be believed. Ropes criss-cross the pool to help swimmers get from one side to the other. The current is startlingly strong when you jump in so the ropes are essential for getting around. You can read more about Puente de Dios in [Vía México](http://viamexico.mx/puente-dios-oasis-divino/) (en español). Of all the swimming destinations we went to I found this one the most beautiful. But be warned, it can get crowded during the height of tourist season. Plan your trip for the off season if you can.

## The Caves

Huasteca Potosina is full of natural caves that offer opportunities for spelunking and rappeling. Among the most famous is the [Cave of Swallows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_Swallows) in the municipality of Aquismón. This open air pit has a 333 meter (1092 feet) drop to the cave floor. The main draw for this cave is the multitude of birds that emerge every morning and return every evening like clockwork. Be sure to time your visit right so you get to see this spectacular site! Despite the name, the birds are primarily swifts and parakeets, there are very few actual swallows in attendance.

There are also plenty of caves to explore in the area, including the Gruta de Xilosuchico outside the town of Xilitla. You can scamble over, under, and between rocks from one chamber to the next as you admire the beautiful natural formations and the chittering bats overhead. You might see a spider or two, so watch where you put your hands! Stalagtites hang from cavernous ceilings and drip continuously, creating a haunting melody. I recommend turning off your helmet light at least once. If the whole group does it you'll be plunged into absolute darkness, which is an eery but fascinating experience.

## Edward James & Las Pozas

The town of Xilitla is a 2-hour drive from Ciudad Valles, but it's a necessary trip if you're in the area. This is the site of [Las Pozas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Pozas), a series of surrealist structures built by Edward James in the heart of the rainforest. Edward James was an eccentric art patron with a lot of money to burn. When he visited the area around Xilitla in the 1940's he was overwhelmed by its beauty and decided to build a private retreat for himself and his friends (mostly surrealist artists), away from the complications of the big city. He employed many local craftsmen and continued to add to the compound until his death in 1984. Since then the site has been open to the public.

The structures blend beautifully with the natural landscape and in true surrealist fashion it's easy to get lost as you navigate the twisting, bizarre architecture. I recommend visiting Las Pozas through a tour company for two reasons. The first is that the guides are full of interesting stories about James and his motivations for building various sections of the garden. The second is that the lines to get in to the complex can stretch on for hours, but the tour companies have arranged reservation times so you get to walk right in with no wait.

Edward James is a fascinating character and I encourage you to learn more about him if you're interested. "[The Secret Life of Edward James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oosdgHLTGY)" is a charming documentary from 1978 about his life and his Surrealist Garden. It's available in its entirety on YouTube.

## Final Thoughts

Huasteca Potosina is a beautiful and oft-overlooked part of the world. If you're seeking adventure and want something outside the normal tourist cicrcuit you should give it a look. Before your trip I advise learning at least a little Spanish since English speakers are rare around here, and I highly recommend taking advantage of one of the many tour agencies in the area to get the most out of your experience. Ruta Huasteca had a handful of English speaking guides so we didn't have any trouble with them acting as translators. Getting to the area can be a chore if you're not familiar with the region, but the tour agencies will take care of everything once you arrive.
