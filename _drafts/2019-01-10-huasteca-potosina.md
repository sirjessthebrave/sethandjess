Hello, friends! Jess and I recently spent a week in Huasteca Potosina, a picturesque region in central Mexico known for its hilly landscapes and brilliant, blue waters. We had been living in Mexico City for a couple months and we were looking to spend a little time in nature around the holidays. Our friend Jonathan suggested Huasteca Potosina, but Jess and I were not familiar with the area. We Googled some pictures and were sold on the idea pretty quickly. The jungles, the waterfalls, and thatch-roofed huts on the river were exactly what we were looking for in our trip.

Huasteca Potosina is a popular vacation destination among locals, but it hasn't quite caught on internationally. This made it tricky to find information in English. We also weren't sure how we were going to get around since the region is a 7 hour drive from Mexico City and many of the attractions are in remote areas. We ultimately decided to take a bus from Mexico City and book a 5 day tour package since, other than the pictures we saw, we knew nothing about the area or what to expect. If you're thinking about going to Huasteca Potosina (you should!) read on and you'll be a little more informed than we were when we arrived.

## Geography and History

The Huasteca region extends through several modern Mexican states and stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. The area is named after the indigenous Huastec people that inhabit the region. There are still people that speak the native Huastec language and follow Huastec traditions, but their influence has waned since the Spanish colonization.

Huasteca Potosina is specifically the part of the Huasteca region that lies within the state of San Luis Potosí. It's a mountainous, rain forest area with several winding rivers cutting through the region. The limestone of the Sierra Madre Orientals causes the rivers to glow a beautiful and almost luminescent blue in the sunlight. The area is temperate most of the year, but temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius at the height of Summer. Agriculture is the most imporant part of the economy here and as you traverse the roads you will see mile after mile of sugar cane fields. The region is also known for its coffee, so be sure to have a cup if you get the chance.

## Transportation and Accomodations

The city of Ciudad Valles lies in the heart of Huasteca Potosina, so this was the first stop on our trip. Mexico City bus stations are hectic places, and schedules are pretty loosely followed, but after some jostling and bit of a wait we were on our way. It was a 9 hour bus ride, but the Futura bus we took had comfortable seats and a bathroom, so we managed. We arrived in the evening and grabbed a taxi (no Lyft or Uber here) to a little hotel near the tour company office. English speakers are few and far between this far from the big city, so getting around and getting checked in really tested our Spanish abilities. There was some confusion, but we managed. We were feeling pretty gross after an all day bus ride, but a shower and some dinner at a little restaurant in town fixed us right up.

We booked a 5 day tour package through Ruta Huasteca, so once we got to town all the details were taken care of for us. I'm really glad we went this route. As I mentioned, there aren't a lot of English speakers in the area and our Spanish isn't great (yet). Also, the attractions in the area are spread out and difficult to find and you really need guides to show you the way and provide safety equipment. After our first night in the hotel we spent the remainder of our evenings at Aldea Huasteca, an ecological lodging complex run by Ruta Huasteca. Letting them take care of all the details meant we could focus on enjoying the trip. Lodging, transportation, meals, equipment, and guides were all provided.

We didn't really know what to expect when we started the trip, which made packing difficult. But now we know, so fear not if you're thinking about going, because we're here to help. First, a lot of the activities involve swimming. A bathing suit is a must. Water shoes are also essential, but you can buy them at all the attractions if you don't own a pair. You'll need to bring your own towel, as well. Since we were using our towels for showers and swimming they were pretty gross by the end of the week. There's nothing like drying off with a damp, mildewy towel after your morning shower. Consider bringing a micro-fiber sport towel if you've got one, so you're not stuck lugging your shower towel around everywhere. A good pair of hiking shoes will also serve you well. You'll spend a lot of time climing up and down muddy mountainsides. All of your clothes will get wet and muddy, so don't bring your Sunday best. And be aware that these eco-lodings don't sell alcohol. Bring your own beers or a bottle of wine if you like to relax with a drink after a day of adventuring.

## The Rivers

Many of the attractions in the area revolve around the beautiful waterways that snake their way through the Sierra Madre Orientals. There are calm areas for swimming, white water rapids for rafting, and beautiful waterfalls for jumping.
