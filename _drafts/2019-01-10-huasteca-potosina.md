Hello, friends! Jess and I recently spent a week in Huasteca Potosina, a picturesque region in central Mexico known for its hilly landscapes and brilliant, blue waters. We had been living in Mexico City for a couple months and we were looking to spend a little time in nature around the holidays. Our friend Jonathan suggested Huasteca Potosina, but Jess and I were not familiar with the area. We Googled some pictures and were sold on the idea pretty quickly. The jungles, the waterfalls, and thatch-roofed huts on the river were exactly what we were looking for in our trip.

Huasteca Potosina is a popular vacation destination among locals, but it hasn't quite caught on internationally. This made it tricky to find information in English. We also weren't sure how we were going to get around since the region is a 7 hour drive from Mexico City and many of the attractions are in remote areas. We ultimately decided to take a bus from Mexico City and book a 5 day tour package since, other than the pictures we saw, we knew nothing about the area or what to expect. If you're thinking about going to Huasteca Potosina (you should!) read on and you'll be a little more informed than we were when we arrived.

## Geography and History

The Huasteca region extends through several modern Mexican states and stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to the Sierra Madre Oriental mountain range. The area is named after the indigenous Huastec people that inhabit the region. There are still people that speak the native Huastec language and follow Huastec traditions, but their influence has waned since the Spanish colonization.

Huasteca Potosina is specifically the part of the Huasteca region that lies within the state of San Luis Potosí. It's a mountainous, rain forest area with several winding rivers cutting through the region. The limestone of the Sierra Madre Orientals causes the rivers to glow a beautiful and almost luminescent blue in the sunlight. The area is temperate most of the year, but temperatures can reach 40 degrees Celsius at the height of Summer. Agriculture is the most imporant part of the economy here and as you traverse the roads you will see mile after mile of sugar cane fields. The region is also known for its coffee, so be sure to have a cup if you get the chance.
