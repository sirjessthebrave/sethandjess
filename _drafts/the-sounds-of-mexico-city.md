When I arrive in a new place I love to spend some time just wandering the streets, taking in the sights and the sounds. I don't mean the museums or the tourist districts crowded with buskers. I'm talking about the neighborhoods. The residential areas. The places where normal people go about their daily lives. It's always interesting to hear the sounds that give a place its unique character. Once I've lived somewhere long enough I begin to tune these things out. I learn to ignore the local wildlife (rats) and I just stop hearing the local chit-chat (obscenity-laden rants).

That's why it's such a great treat to visit a new town, preferably far from home. Everything is new, and I'm able to appreciate it with eyes and ears wide open. New houses! New shops! New animals! New curse words! And while it is fascinating to take in all these new stimuli it can also be a tad overwhelming, especially in a sprawling metropolis like Mexico City.

And this place is noisy. Really noisy. Life is lived in the streets here in a way that can be startling to those not used to it (that is to say, me). If you're looking to buy something there will be somebody out on the sidewalk looking to sell it. Don't worry about finding them, they will find you. And they will be yelling. Hungry? Not for long. The streets are filled with people making and eating food. Tortas, tacos, chilaquiles, fresh fruit, and everything else. The sounds of sizzling oil, meat on the grill, and vegetables being chopped are ever present. The food is good, but be warned, if you're not used to eating street food then your gastrointestinal system will react exactly as you would expect.

Do you like dogs? Do you like **one million** dogs? Well good news, then, they are everywhere in Mexico City. I think it is a law here that every citizen must own at least three. They're adorable, don't get me wrong, but boy do they bark. All day and all night. Go to Parque México on a Saturday and you'll get an interesting glimpse into a Twilight Zone-esque world where dogs rule and humans are but their faithful and obedient servants.

To say that Mexico City has a traffic problem is a massive understatement. The traffic signs and lights are taken as mere suggestions here, and gridlock is frequent. Expect to hear blaring car horns at all hours. And just like everywhere else in the world these horns accomplish absolutely nothing. Other drivers never clear a path, much to the chagrin and surprise of the red-faced, white-knuckled horn honkers. If I had my way honking a car horn would be a criminal offense, punishable by a lengthy stay in a pillory in the town square. If I ever run for office this will be my primary campaign promise.

House parties are frequent occurences as well, and they can easily go all night. Fueled by tequila and chicharrónes, they are not quiet affairs. My advice is to keep earplugs handy. Or better yet keep a bottle of tequila handy and join in the fun.

But definitely of the most fascinating noises come from the travelling street vendors. They have loud-speakers and steam whistles and there is an eery quality about them that is a little unnerving at night, at least before you get used to it.

## Tamales oaxaqueños! Tamales calientitos!

Ever wake up in the middle of the night craving a tamale? This is your guy.

## Estufas! Lavadoras!

These guys aren't looking to sell you anything, they're looking to buy. Have an old appliance that you don't want or need? They're happy to take it off your hands. The voice you're hearing is that of María del Mar Terrón Martínez. Her father, Marco Antonio Terrón Aguilar, was a scrap collector that got tired of losing his voice shouting into a megaphone. So he recorded his daughter giving the pitch, put it on a loop, and the rest is history. The recording has spread and is now used not only in Mexico City, but throughout Latin America. If you want to learn more you can read all about it in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/es/2016/10/18/postales-del-mundo-de-quien-es-esa-voz-que-pide-chatarra-en-ciudad-de-mexico/) (en español, lo siento).

## Camotes (Sweet Potatoes)

This is the scary one when you're not expecting it. It's not a recording or a loud speaker, it's a loud-as-hell steam whistle attached to a mobile pressure cooker. You can hear this guy from blocks away, and it is positively deafening when you're right next to it. Be sure to speak loudly when ordering, as these vendors blew out their eardrums years ago.

## More Cowbell!

Garbage collectors criss-cross the neighborhoods frequently and ring a loud handbell to let everyone know it's time to bring out the garbage. On a side note it's amazing how much trash these folks can stack on top of the truck, Tetris style.
