One of my favorite things about visiting a new place is listening to all the unfamiliar sounds. On every street there are a hundred little things buzzing and clanking if you stop and listen for them. And every place is different! Every neighborhood has its own collection of noises and its own distinct charm. Unfortunately, when you're at home it's easy for all those noises to fade away into the background. Once you get used to them you just stop hearing them. That's why it's such a treat to visit a new town, especially one that's far from home. Everything is new, and you can appreciate the music of the streets with ears wide open. There are new animals, new vehicles, and new languages. And while its fascinating to take in all these new auditory treats it can also be a tad overwhelming, especially in a sprawling metropolis like Mexico City.

And wow is this place noisy. Shockingly noisy at times. Life is lived in the streets here in a way that can be startling to those not used to it (that is to say, me). If you're looking to buy something don't worry about going into a store. There will be somebody out on the sidewalk trying to sell exactly what you need. Finding them won't be a problem because you will hear them hawking their wares before you're even close. And if you're hungry? Not to worry. The streets are filled with people making and eating food. Tortas, tacos, chilaquiles, fresh fruit, and everything else. The sounds of sizzling oil, meat on the grill, and vegetables being chopped are ever present. And the food is great. You should definitely try it if you get the chance. You might experience some intestinal distress if you're not used to this kind of food, but it's worth it.

To say that Mexico City has a traffic problem is a massive understatement. The traffic signs and lights are taken as mere suggestions here, and gridlock is frequent. Expect to hear blaring car horns at all hours. And just like everywhere else in the world these horns accomplish absolutely nothing. Other drivers never clear a path, much to the chagrin and surprise of the red-faced, white-knuckled horn honkers. Despite this they go right on honking. If I had my way using a car horn would be a criminal offense, punishable by a lengthy stay in a pillory in the town square. But for now it's just something you have to live with.

Do you like dogs? Do you like **one million** dogs? Well, then, I've got good news for you. Dogs are everywhere in Mexico City. I think it is a law here that every citizen must own at least three. They're adorable, don't get me wrong, but boy do they bark. All day and all night. Go to Parque México on a Saturday and you'll see a world where dogs rule and humans are little more than their faithful and obedient companions.

Bars and restaurants often stay open through the night here. And house parties can easily last until dawn. Fueled by tequila and chicharrónes, these are not quiet affairs. My advice is to keep earplugs handy if you want to get any sleep. Or better yet forget the sleep, pick up a bottle of tequila, and join in the fun.

Some of the most fascinating noises come from the travelling street vendors. They have loud-speakers and steam whistles and there is an eery quality about them that is a little unnerving at night, at least when you're not expecting it. And if your Spanish could use some work (I know mine can) it can be even more baffling, because you have no idea what everyone is yelling about.

## Tamales oaxaqueños! Tamales calientitos!

Ever wake up in the middle of the night craving a tamale? This is your guy. The same recording is used by countless tamale vendors throughout the city. It has permeated Mexican pop culture so much that you can hear it in songs, ring tones, and TV shows.

## Estufas! Lavadoras!

These guys aren't looking to sell you anything, they're looking to buy. Have an old appliance that you don't want or need? They're happy to take it off your hands. The voice you're hearing is that of María del Mar Terrón Martínez. Her father, Marco Antonio Terrón Aguilar, was a scrap collector that got tired of losing his voice shouting into a megaphone. So he recorded his daughter giving the pitch, put it on a loop, and the rest is history. The recording has spread and is now used not only in Mexico City, but throughout Latin America. If you want to learn more you can read all about it in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/es/2016/10/18/postales-del-mundo-de-quien-es-esa-voz-que-pide-chatarra-en-ciudad-de-mexico/) (en español).

## Camotes (Sweet Potatoes)

This is the scary one when you're not expecting it. It's not a recording or a loud speaker, it's a loud-as-hell steam whistle attached to a mobile pressure cooker. You can hear this guy from blocks away, and it is positively deafening when you're right next to it. Be sure to speak loudly when ordering, as these vendors blew out their eardrums years ago.

## More Cowbell!

Garbage collectors criss-cross the neighborhoods frequently and ring a loud handbell to let everyone know it's time to bring out the garbage. On a side note it's amazing how much trash these folks can stack on top of the truck, Tetris style.
